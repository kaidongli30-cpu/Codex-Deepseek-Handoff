## What problem does this project solve?

DeepSeek's official integration already provides a way to use Codex with
DeepSeek, but after switching configurations you often run into this:

- Tasks that were visible in GPT mode do not appear in DeepSeek mode;
- New replies from DeepSeek cannot be continued after switching back to GPT;
- DeepSeek reasoning records or web-search records can make GPT report format
  errors.

This project adds a local "handoff" layer between GPT and DeepSeek. The visible
flow is:

```text
Work in GPT
    ↓
Fully close Codex
    ↓
Click "DeepSeek交接" on the desktop
    ↓
The tool hands off the tasks, then opens Codex in DeepSeek mode
    ↓
Continue the original task in DeepSeek
    ↓
Fully close Codex
    ↓
Click "任务交接GPT" on the desktop
    ↓
The tool cleans up and hands off the tasks, then opens Codex in GPT mode
```

Both sides see relay versions of the same workflow. DeepSeek replies can be
handed back to GPT, and new GPT replies can be handed on to DeepSeek.

## Three things to know before you start

1. **This project is not Codex and does not provide a DeepSeek API key.** You
   need Codex installed and your own official DeepSeek API key.
2. **Fully close Codex before switching.** Never run GPT mode and DeepSeek mode
   at the same time.
3. **Click a shortcut only once during a handoff.** With a lot of history this
   can take a while; Codex opens only after the handoff finishes.

## Before you install

### 1. Confirm you are on Windows

Currently supported:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

macOS and Linux have not been verified with this project yet.

### 2. Confirm Codex opens normally

Open Codex the way you normally do, sign in to ChatGPT/OpenAI, and open an
existing task. Then fully close Codex.

If Codex is not installed yet, install and sign in from the
[official OpenAI entry](https://developers.openai.com/) first, then come back.

### 3. Install PowerShell 7

PowerShell is the window used below for pasting and running the installation
commands. Windows ships with an older one called "Windows PowerShell"; this
project recommends **PowerShell 7**.

Open the Windows Start menu, search for and open `PowerShell 7`. In the window,
copy this command and press Enter:

```powershell
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

If the first line shows major version `7`, this requirement is satisfied.

If you cannot find PowerShell 7, follow Microsoft's official instructions:

- [Microsoft: Install PowerShell 7 on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/install-powershell-on-windows)

Windows 11 users can also run this in a terminal:

```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget
```

After installing, close the old window and reopen `PowerShell 7`.

### 4. Install Node.js

In PowerShell 7, run:

```powershell
node --version
```

If it prints something like `v20...`, `v22...`, or `v24...`, it is installed.

If `node` is not recognized, download the **LTS (long-term support)** version
from the official Node.js website:

- [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Keep the default installation options. Reopen PowerShell 7 and run
`node --version` again.

### 5. Prepare your DeepSeek API key

You need your own official DeepSeek API key. Never share it, never write it into
this project's files, and never commit it to GitHub. DeepSeek's official
documentation is here:

- [DeepSeek API official docs](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/api/deepseek-api/)

If you can already open Codex through DeepSeek's official setup, skip to the
next section.

## Download this project

### Option A: Download the ZIP (recommended for beginners)

1. Open this project's GitHub page.
2. Click the green `Code` button at the top.
3. Click `Download ZIP`.
4. Once downloaded, find the ZIP file in File Explorer.
5. Right-click the ZIP and choose `Extract All`.
6. Open the extracted folder.

Keep opening folders until you can see all of these at once:

```text
README.md
package.json
work folder
scripts folder
```

Seeing these files means you are in the correct "project root".

### Open PowerShell 7 in the correct folder

1. Keep the project-root window open.
2. Click the address bar at the top of File Explorer.
3. Delete the existing text.
4. Type `pwsh`.
5. Press Enter.

PowerShell 7 opens, already in the correct project folder.

Check with this command:

```powershell
Test-Path ".\work\thread-localizer\launcher\install.ps1"
```

Expected output:

```text
True
```

If it prints `False`, close PowerShell, go back into the folder that actually
contains `README.md`, `package.json`, and `work`, and type `pwsh` again.

## First installation

### Step 1: Complete DeepSeek's official setup first

This project does not redistribute DeepSeek's official model catalog, so you
must run DeepSeek's official Codex setup script first.

In the PowerShell 7 window from above, copy the whole block and press Enter:

```powershell
$officialSetup = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'codex-deepseek-setup-en.ps1'
Invoke-WebRequest `
  -Uri 'https://cdn.deepseek.com/api-docs/codex-deepseek-setup-en.ps1' `
  -OutFile $officialSetup
notepad $officialSetup
```

Notepad opens the downloaded official script. Confirm the download address is
`cdn.deepseek.com`, close Notepad, then run:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $officialSetup
```

Follow the official script's prompts to configure your DeepSeek API key.

Afterwards:

1. Fully close PowerShell and Codex.
2. Open Codex once using the entry created by DeepSeek's official script.
3. Confirm DeepSeek replies normally to a test message.
4. Fully close Codex again.

If DeepSeek itself cannot reply yet, do not install this project. The handoff
layer only works after the official base setup succeeds.

### Step 2: Preview what the installer will do

Return to the project root and open PowerShell 7 with `pwsh` as before.

Copy this whole block and press Enter:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File ".\work\thread-localizer\launcher\install.ps1" `
  -SourceRoot "$PWD" `
  -WhatIf
```

`-WhatIf` means "preview only, make no real changes". You will see several
`What if:` lines and, at the end:

```text
"whatIf": true
```

This step does not migrate tasks, start Codex, or send any model request.

If a red error appears here, check the FAQ below first. Do not keep running the
real install command.

### Step 3: Install

After the preview reports no errors, run this in the same PowerShell 7 window.
It is the same command without `-WhatIf`:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File ".\work\thread-localizer\launcher\install.ps1" `
  -SourceRoot "$PWD"
```

The installer will:

- back up the relevant Codex configuration;
- verify the new configuration can be read by the installed Codex;
- install the handoff tools;
- create two shortcuts on the desktop.

It does not directly modify Codex's task database, delete original tasks, or
send messages automatically.

### Step 4: Confirm the desktop shortcuts

After a successful install, the desktop should show:

```text
DeepSeek交接
任务交接GPT
```

Their roles are:

| Shortcut | When to click | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DeepSeek交接` | You are using GPT and want to switch to DeepSeek | Hands GPT tasks to DeepSeek, then opens Codex |
| `任务交接GPT` | You are using DeepSeek and want to return to GPT | Cleans up and hands DeepSeek tasks back to GPT, then opens Codex |

## Your first handoff

Use a throwaway test task for the first acceptance check.

### Switching from GPT to DeepSeek

1. Open Codex with the normal GPT sign-in.
2. Create a test task and send an easy-to-recognize message, for example:

   ```text
   This is a GPT and DeepSeek handoff test.
   ```

3. Wait for GPT to finish replying.
4. Fully close Codex.
5. Wait a few seconds and confirm the Codex window is completely gone.
6. Double-click `DeepSeek交接` on the desktop.
7. **Click once, then wait.**
8. When the handoff finishes, Codex opens automatically with the DeepSeek
   configuration.
9. Find the test task in "Recent" or in the matching project.
10. Confirm you can see GPT's test message and reply.
11. Ask DeepSeek to reply in the same task.

### Switching from DeepSeek back to GPT

1. Wait until DeepSeek finishes replying.
2. Fully close Codex.
3. Wait a few seconds.
4. Double-click `任务交接GPT` on the desktop.
5. **Click once, then wait.**
6. The tool first handles reasoning and web-search records that are
   incompatible with GPT.
7. When it finishes, Codex returns to the GPT sign-in configuration.
8. Open the test task.
9. Confirm you can see what DeepSeek just sent.
10. Send GPT another message and confirm it replies.

If all of the above works, bidirectional handoff is working.

## Everyday usage

From now on, remember only two rules:

- **GPT → DeepSeek:** close Codex, then click `DeepSeek交接`.
- **DeepSeek → GPT:** close Codex, then click `任务交接GPT`.

Do not click the official Codex icon in the taskbar right after using DeepSeek.
That bypasses the handoff step, and the newest DeepSeek content may not appear
in the GPT task yet.

## Why doesn't Codex appear immediately after I click a shortcut?

This is by design; it does not mean the shortcut is broken.

The tool must first:

1. find the tasks that need handoff;
2. check whether they were already handed off, to avoid duplicates;
3. back up the needed data;
4. convert incompatible records;
5. verify the handoff result;
6. only then open Codex.

The more tasks there are, the longer it may take. Clicking the shortcut again
does not make it faster and may make you think the program is stuck, so wait
for the first click to finish.

## FAQ

### 1. The installer says `models-deepseek.json` is missing

The official DeepSeek base setup has not finished successfully, or the official
model catalog is not where the installer expects it.

How to fix:

1. Rerun the official script from "Complete DeepSeek's official setup first".
2. Confirm DeepSeek opens Codex on its own and replies normally.
3. Fully close Codex.
4. Run this project's installer again.

Do not create an empty `models-deepseek.json`; an empty file cannot replace the
official model catalog.

### 2. No window appears for a long time after clicking a shortcut

Do not click repeatedly. Wait for the handoff to finish. If an error dialog
appears, record:

- the full text in the dialog;
- the report path shown in the dialog;
- whether you were switching GPT → DeepSeek or DeepSeek → GPT.

See the [troubleshooting guide](docs/troubleshooting.md) for details.

### 3. The task appears in "Recent" but is not pinned

If the task opens, the messages are complete, and you can continue replying,
the handoff worked. Pinning is a Codex UI state and does not affect task
context. Pin it manually if you want.

### 4. There are two old tasks with the same name

Early tests or failed handoffs can leave old tasks. Do not judge by the name
alone; open them and confirm which one is newest and can still reply. Do not
directly modify Codex databases or rollout files.

### 5. GPT reports `Invalid input[*].content ... maximum length 0`

This usually means an old DeepSeek reasoning record was not converted. The
current version cleans the incompatible `content` field on new targets during
the DeepSeek → GPT handoff. Keep the error report and backup; do not manually
delete source task records. See the [troubleshooting guide](docs/troubleshooting.md).

### 6. Switching back to GPT fails after DeepSeek web search

DeepSeek and GPT may use different web-search record ID formats. This project
realigns the linked IDs between search calls and results when handing the task
back to GPT; if a collision is found, it stops and reports instead of deleting
records.

### 7. DeepSeek replies but cannot understand images

The handoff tool only preserves and converts task context; it does not add
vision capabilities to a model. Whether images work depends on the DeepSeek
model and API capabilities you selected.

## How to uninstall

Fully close Codex first.

Open PowerShell 7 and run the preview command:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\model-switcher\uninstall.ps1" `
  -WhatIf
```

After the preview looks correct, uninstall:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\model-switcher\uninstall.ps1"
```

By default, uninstall removes only the managed configuration, the two
shortcuts, and the program files installed by this project. These are kept:

- DeepSeek's official model catalog;
- the encrypted API key;
- handoff manifests;
- handoff reports and backups.

## Defaults

- DeepSeek reasoning effort: `max`
- DeepSeek web search: `live`
- OpenAI/GPT: preserve the GPT model the task was using, when known

To switch DeepSeek models later, the new model must be declared by the official
catalog and support the Responses API that Codex needs. Normal users do not
need to edit `config.toml` manually.

## Privacy and safety

This project calls the Codex `app-server` already installed on your machine:

- it does not run a chat relay server;
- it does not upload chat records to any server run by this project's author;
- it does not write API keys into Git;
- it does not directly modify `state_5.sqlite`, `session_index.jsonl`, or source
  rollouts;
- it generates dry-run reports and timestamped backups before writes;
- it stops when the installed Codex protocol is incompatible, instead of
  guessing fields and continuing;
- a handoff manifest prevents the same task from being copied twice;
- a per-user lock prevents repeated clicks from starting multiple handoffs.

See the [safety guide](docs/safety.md) for details.

## For developers

If you only want to install and use the tool, stop reading here. The rest is
for people who want to inspect the code, debug protocol issues, or contribute.

### Local tests

From the project root:

```powershell
npm test
pwsh -NoProfile -File ".\scripts\check-powershell.ps1"
```

### Protocol check and dry-run

```powershell
npm run schema-check
npm run dry-run:deepseek
npm run dry-run:openai
```

`schema-check` only checks or caches the Codex app-server protocol and does not
start a model turn. Dry runs only generate reports; when changing migration
logic for the first time, validate one task before widening the scope.

### Changing the default model

Provider defaults live at
[work/thread-localizer/data/handoff-settings.json](work/thread-localizer/data/handoff-settings.json):

- OpenAI uses `preserve-existing`, returning to the GPT model the task used
  before.
- DeepSeek uses `global`; after changing `activeModel`, the next handoff uses
  the new model.
- The DeepSeek model slug must exist in the local official
  `models-deepseek.json`.
